      or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could
      affect the availability and functionality of the Site.
      You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be
      rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by
      modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you
      each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to

      We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels,

    </ul>
    <p>You should be aware that getting a new computer,
    installing a new browser, upgrading an existing

</p>
    <p><strong>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
</strong></p>
    <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites
    and applications of interest, including advertisements
    and external services that are not affiliated with us.
    Once you have used these links to leave the Site,
    any information you provide to these third parties
    is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot
    guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.
    Before visiting and providing any information to any
    third-party websites, you should inform yourself of
    the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the
    third party responsible for that website, and
    should take those steps necessary to, in your
    discretion, protect the privacy of your information.
    We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
    security practices and policies of any third parties,
    including other sites, services or applications

    <p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical
    security measures to help protect your personal
    information. While we have taken reasonable steps
    to secure the personal information you provide

    no security measures are perfect or impenetrable,
    and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
    against any interception or other type of misuse.
    Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to
    interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security

</p>
    <p><strong>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems
    include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
    you can activate to signal your privacy preference
    not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected.
    No uniform technology standard for recognizing
    and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
    As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
    signals or any other mechanism that automatically
    communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
    we must follow in the future, we will inform you
    about that practice in a revised version of this
    Privacy Policy. Most web browsers and some mobile
    operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
    feature or setting you can activate to signal your
    privacy preference not to have data about your online
    browsing activities monitored and collected. If you
    set the DNT signal on your browser,
    we will respond to such DNT browser signals.
